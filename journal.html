		Creating Stars - Website Design
	</h2>

	<div class = "paragraph" id = "p1"> 
		<p>
		Today I worked on putting stars on my website. Instead of taking an image from online, I had to do a deep search to figure out how to code them. I ended up making three triangles that overlap and create a star. I coppied the code several times in order to make several stars. Currently I have five stars, each with a different color. </p>

			Positioning Stars - Website Design
		</h3>

		<div class = "paragraph" id = "p2"> 
			<p>
			Today I spent time trying to position my stars. Because of the complexity of the code, I am struggling to change their sizes. Similarly,I find it hard to position them in the right spot. For some reason I have to use negative numbers to move certain stars up to the screen. </p>

			<p>
			Questions:
			- How to make a border around my text?
			- How to add an image of stars to main screen background and keep other stars ontop?
			- How to position the stars correctly?  </p>
		</div>
