		Creating Stars - Website Design
	</h2>

	<div class = "paragraph" id = "p1"> 
		<p>
		Today I worked on putting stars on my website. Instead of taking an image from online, I had to do a deep search to figure out how to code them. I ended up making three triangles that overlap and create a star. I coppied the code several times in order to make several stars. Currently I have five stars, each with a different color. </p>
	</div>

			Positioning Stars - Website Design
	</h3>

	<div class = "paragraph" id = "p2"> 
			<p>
			Today I spent time trying to position my stars. Because of the complexity of the code, I am struggling to change their sizes. Similarly,I find it hard to position them in the right spot. For some reason I have to use negative numbers to move certain stars up to the screen. </p>

			<p>
			Questions:
			- How to make a border around my text?
			- How to add an image of stars to main screen background and keep other stars ontop?
			- How to position the stars correctly?  </p>
	</div>

			Creating A New Design For My Website
	</h4>

		<div class = "paragraph" id = "p3"> 
			<p>
			Today I worked on redesigning my website. Trying to work with the stars was too complicated, and I realized I was not able to efficiently switc between pages. I started by making the asthetic of my journal the theme for my entire webstie. Then, I created a table which allows me to section my three categories: projects, journal, and (tbd). I created links to the other pages so I can now access my projects and journal from my website. </p>

			<p>
			For now, I have several things to work on. I have to work in Adobe Illustrator to create icons for my projects as well as the three options for my home page. I will also continue to add journal entries, and work on a plan for my ocean themed project. Finally, I am working to figure out why my platypus doodle is not showing up on my website. </p>

			Icons
	</h5>

		<div class = "paragraph" id = "p4"> 
			<p>
			This week I've continued to work on creating new icons for my project. I've now completed my icons for the poject and jounral categories, as well as the platty game. I am having trouble pushing these new images, and even in a Lab with Molly we cannot figure it out. Github is being very sketchy. For now I'll turn to focusing on my project for Eme.

			My new project
	</h6>

		<div class = "paragraph" id = "p5"> 
			<p>
			Today I have decided what my new project will be. I am going to create little games about ocean animals and link them to a larger page on my website. The games will include things like staying away from an eel that is trying to shock you.

			Creating the first prototype for the first game
	</h7>

		<div class = "paragraph" id = "p6"> 
			<p>
			 My first game will be ESCAPE THE EEL (name tbd), where the player has to stay away from the eel's lightning bolts so as not to get shocked. I've been working in scratch to prototype this, and here's what I've done:

			 - all charaters cannot leave the bounds of the screen
			 - the lightning spite folliws the eel spirte, and both turn and move the same amount
			 - the lightning gets thicker (or flashes) throughout the game.
			 - the player broadcasts game over when it hits the lighting and has a little animation
			 - the player can move with the four arrows
			</p>

 		CREATED PROTOTYPE FOR OCTUPUS GAME

	</h8>

		<div class = "paragraph" id = "p7"> 
			<p>
			 Today I created a game about an octupus that squirts ink. The objective is to clean in up as fast as you can. Here's what I've done:

			 - the player has the ability to move with 4 arrows
			 - an octupus sprite paints the entire background after it falls from the top of the screen and grows
			 - the player paints over it in white so it looks like it erases the first layer

			 Future: It should run off of a timer or there would be no way to die. There is also a tiny corner that isn't getting erazed because the player cannot reach it. I could change its boundaries, but then it would end up going off screen at times.

 		CREATED PROTOTYPE FOR SPEAR ANIMAL GAME

	</h9>

		<div class = "paragraph" id = "p8"> 
			<p>
			 Today I created a game that shoots spears at the player immitating an animal that I don't know of yet. (I rememember talking about this animal with molly but what it is and what it does is unknown to me at the moment). What it does:
			 - spears start at right side of the screen.
			 - the main one goes up and down while clones of it are created
			 - the clones move leftward towards the player
			 - using the four arrows the player has to evade the spears
			 - if the spears touch the player, game over is broadcasted. 

			 What I want to do:
			 - turn that main spear into the animal when I learn what it is
			 - change the code so that those spears know to change their costume to spear instead of animal
			 - create 2-4 more of these games in scratch
			 - start coding these in sublime text
			 - edit the headers to each of my journal entries (right now only some have style)
			 - add my room to my website
			 - find new images which are higher quality for the games(maybe make in Adobe?)
			 - add sound effects?

 		CREATION OF A FUNCTION

		<div class = "paragraph" id = "p9">

			Today I made a new html file for a function. This function is run 100 times and it prints a picture of a dog.

 		CREATION OF AN ARRAY

		<div class = "paragraph" id = "p10">

			 Today I created an array with a button. It allows you to input your favorite dog. I hope to make it so that people can paste an image into it instead.

	 		LEARNED ABOUT FIZZBUZZ

	</h12>

			<div class = "paragraph" id = "p11"> 
				<p>
				 
				 After meeting with Molly, I created a scratch project today called FIZZBUZZ. It prints out the numbers 1-100, but for every multiple of 3 it prints FIZZ, for every multiple of 5 in prints BUZZ and for every multiple of 15 it prints FIZZBUZZ.

	 		A MAGIC TRICK

	</h13>

			<div class = "paragraph" id = "p12">

					Today I have worked on a project that creates the image of a pineapple and  puts it in a random location. This repeats in a for loop set to run 100 times.

	 		ISSUES WITH THE MAGIC TRICK

	</h14>

			<div class = "paragraph" id = "p12"> 
				<p>
				 
					When working on the magic trick, I can accross an issue which was that I could only view one pineapple instead of all 100. So, I went through my code and figured out that I had issues with possitioning and defining some variables. After I fixed that, I added a botton which allows me to make all the pineapples dissapear. Finally, I put in a background to make it more fun. Now, the only thing I need to do is make them move around.

			RUNNERS
	</h15>

			<div class = "paragraph" id = "p13"> 
				<p>
				 
					Today I made a project that takes 3 divs and has them move across the sceen. This was inspired by Molly's car code sketch, but I changed the characters to gifs of people running so that it looks pretty realistic (for 2D).
