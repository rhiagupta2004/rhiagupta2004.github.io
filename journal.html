		Creating Stars - Website Design
	</h2>

	<div class = "paragraph" id = "p1"> 
		<p>
		Today I worked on putting stars on my website. Instead of taking an image from online, I had to do a deep search to figure out how to code them. I ended up making three triangles that overlap and create a star. I coppied the code several times in order to make several stars. Currently I have five stars, each with a different color. </p>

			Positioning Stars - Website Design
		</h3>

		<div class = "paragraph" id = "p2"> 
			<p>
			Today I spent time trying to position my stars. Because of the complexity of the code, I am struggling to change their sizes. Similarly,I find it hard to position them in the right spot. For some reason I have to use negative numbers to move certain stars up to the screen. </p>

			<p>
			Questions:
			- How to make a border around my text?
			- How to add an image of stars to main screen background and keep other stars ontop?
			- How to position the stars correctly?  </p>
		</div>

			Creating A New Design For My Website
	</h4>

		<div class = "paragraph" id = "p3"> 
			<p>
			Today I worked on redesigning my website. Trying to work with the stars was too complicated, and I realized I was not able to efficiently switc between pages. I started by making the asthetic of my journal the theme for my entire webstie. Then, I created a table which allows me to section my three categories: projects, journal, and (tbd). I created links to the other pages so I can now access my projects and journal from my website. </p>

			<p>
			For now, I have several things to work on. I have to work in Adobe Illustrator to create icons for my projects as well as the three options for my home page. I will also continue to add journal entries, and work on a plan for my ocean themed project. Finally, I am working to figure out why my platypus doodle is not showing up on my website. </p>

			Icons
	</h5>

		<div class = "paragraph" id = "p4"> 
			<p>
			This week I've continued to work on creating new icons for my project. I've now completed my icons for the poject and jounral categories, as well as the platty game. I am having trouble pushing these new images, and even in a Lab with Molly we cannot figure it out. Github is being very sketchy. For now I'll turn to focusing on my project for Eme.

			My new project
	</h6>

		<div class = "paragraph" id = "p5"> 
			<p>
			Today I have decided what my new project will be. I am going to create little games about ocean animals and link them to a larger page on my website. The games will include things like staying away from an eel that is trying to shock you.

			Creating the first prototype for the first game
	</h7>

		<div class = "paragraph" id = "p6"> 
			<p>
			 My first game will be ESCAPE THE EEL (name tbd), where the player has to stay away from the eel's lightning bolts so as not to get shocked. I've been working in scratch to prototype this, and here's what I've done:

			 - all charaters cannot leave the bounds of the screen
			 - the lightning spite folliws the eel spirte, and both turn and move the same amount
			 - the lightning gets thicker (or flashes) throughout the game.
			 - the player broadcasts game over when it hits the lighting and has a little animation
			 - the player can move with the four arrows
			</p>
